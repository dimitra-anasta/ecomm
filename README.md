## User Story


```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

## Description

I was assigned to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I creates Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I used routes to create ways to get all information, get specific information, update specific information, and delete items. 

## Installation

To run the command line application, you have to run an integrated terminal and install npm. You also run mysql and source the schema. Next you run your seed and do an npm start. Once all this is done, you open Insomnia, where you run the localhost with specific routes to create, udpdate, or dlete data from the database. 

## Usage

This is a great use for companies like Shopify to keep track of their inventories.
